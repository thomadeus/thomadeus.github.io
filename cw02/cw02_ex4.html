    <p class="verse chorus"> Just gonna stand there and watch me burn</p> 
    <p class="verse chorus">   Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts</p> 
    <p class="verse chorus">  Just gonna stand there and hear me cry</p> 
    <p class="verse chorus">  Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie</p> 
    <p class="verse chorus">  I love the way you lie </p>

    <p class="verse"> I can't tell you what it really is </p> 
    <p class="verse"> I can only tell you what it feels like </p> 
    <p class="verse"> And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe </p> 
    <p class="verse"> I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight </p> 
    <p class="verse"> As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight </p> 
    <p class="verse"> High off of love drunk from my hate </p> 
    <p class="verse"> It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer </p> 
    <p class="verse"> I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown </p> 
    <p class="verse"> She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me </p> 
    <p class="verse"> And I love it, wait </p> 
    <p class="verse"> Where you going? I'm leaving you </p> 
    <p class="verse"> No you ain't, come back </p> 
    <p class="verse"> We're running right back, here we go again </p> 
    <p class="verse"> It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great </p> 
    <p class="verse"> I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane </p> 
    <p class="verse"> But when it's bad, it's awful </p> 
    <p class="verse"> I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude? </p> 
    <p class="verse"> I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her </p> 
    <p class="verse"> I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength </p> 

    <p class="verse chorus"> Just gonna stand there and watch me burn</p> 
    <p class="verse chorus">   Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts</p> 
    <p class="verse chorus">  Just gonna stand there and hear me cry</p> 
    <p class="verse chorus">  Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie</p> 
    <p class="verse chorus">  I love the way you lie </p> 
    
    <p class="verse">You ever love somebody so much</p>
    <p class="verse">You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
    <p class="verse">And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
    <p class="verse">Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
    <p class="verse">Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em</p>
    <p class="verse">You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
    <p class="verse">Now you're in each other's face,</p>
    <p class="verse">Spewing venom in your words, when you spit 'em
    <p class="verse">You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em</p>
    <p class="verse">Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em</p>
    <p class="verse">It's the rage that took over it controls you both</p>
    <p class="verse">So they say it's best, to go your separate ways</p>
    <p class="verse">Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday</p>
    <p class="verse">Yesterday is over, it's a different day</p>
    <p class="verse">Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her</p>
    <p class="verse">Next time you'll show restraint</p>
    <p class="verse">You don't get another chance</p>
    <p class="verse">Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again</p>
    <p class="verse">Now you get to watch her leave</p>
    <p class="verse">Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane</p>
    
    <p class="verse chorus"> Just gonna stand there and watch me burn</p> 
    <p class="verse chorus">   Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts</p>

    <p class="verse chorus">  Well that's alright, because I love the way you lie</p> 
    <p class="verse chorus">  I love the way you lie </p> 

    <p class="verse"> Now I know we said things, did things  </p>
    <p class="verse"> That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns </p>
    <p class="verse"> Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is </p>
    <p class="verse"> You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded </p>
    <p class="verse"> Baby please come back, it wasn't you </p>
    <p class="verse"> Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems </p>
    <p class="verse"> Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano </p>
    <p class="verse"> All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now </p>
    <p class="verse"> Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk </p>
    <p class="verse"> Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk? </p>
    <p class="verse"> Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball </p>
    <p class="verse"> Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall </p>
    <p class="verse"> Next time, there will be no next time </p>
    <p class="verse"> I apologize even though I know it's lies </p>
    <p class="verse"> I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar </p>
    <p class="verse"> If she ever tries to fucking leave again </p>
    <p class="verse"> I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire </p>

    <p class="verse chorus"> Just gonna stand there and watch me burn</p> 
    <p class="verse chorus">   Well that's alright, because I like the way it hurts</p> 
    <p class="verse chorus">  Just gonna stand there and hear me cry</p>
